#Gabb
An interactive bug fixing activity for WDI Students
## Installation
Clone the repo.
## Usage
### Starting
Run problem_solving.rb, then follow instructions.

### Activity Log
The errors and your solution descriptions are logged into a file named 'log.txt'.

## To Do
* Completing a bug fix should do the following:
  * Copy the fixed file to the `output/` folder
  * Reset the original file in the `exercises/` folder.
  * Save the current `log.txt` to the `output/` folder.
    * Should be timestamped for the current 'session' of bugfixing
    * If a log for this bugfixing session already exists, should replace it with the updated log.
* Starting a new session should empty out the `log.txt` file.
* More bug fixing activities.
* Failing to fix a problem should provide the student with a random tip.
