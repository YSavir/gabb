#Gabb
An interactive bug fixing activity for WDI Students
## Installation
Clone the repo.
## Usage
### Starting
Run problem_solving.rb, then follow instructions.

### Activity Log
Whenever starting a bugfixing session, a folder is created in the `output` folder. In this folder is a `log.txt` file, which tracks the bugs and your solutions. Whenever you fix a bug, a copy of the fixed file will be saved to this folder.

## To Do
* Improve this horrible code
* More bug fixing activities.
* Failing to fix a problem should provide the student with a random tip.
